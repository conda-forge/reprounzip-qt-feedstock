  description: |
    ReproZip is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible
    experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common
    denominator in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and
    creates a package that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies
    required to run a given command on the author's computational environment
    (packing step). A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his
    environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).
